              Chad Caswell, son of nationally acclaimed sculptor Rip Caswell, Chad, grew up in and around galleries, art shows, and the constant creation of sculptures. Chad’s toy of choice would be the ever present clay from his father’s studio. With help from the soft clay his imagination often took shape which allowed him to express the joy and the wonder he experienced when viewing the frogs, lizards and turtles he discovered on the families rural property in Hockinson Washington.
<br>
<br>
              By age Ten, Chad found demand for his work and began selling to his admirers. His skills developed further as he explored art for the pure joy of it. Chad was eighteen when his father; who felt it was time to critique and develop his son’s natural talent, offered him a job as assistant sculptor on several commissioned monument works. Chad quickly learned the fine details of creating feathers for seven life-size geese for the City of Tualatin’s entryway monument, which was completed and installed in April of 2012.
<br>
<br>
              Since then, Chad has assisted in adding story specific details to the life-and-one-quarter sized monuments of Mary, Joseph and the Crucifixion for a cathedral in Kansas. After the completion of this major project Chad moved into studying production at his father’s fine art foundry, learning, hands-on, the ancient lost wax process of casting. Chad learned fast under the mentorship and experience of the artists and foundry men with whom he worked. His skills developed to the point that currently he plays a major role in the sculpting of a life-and-one-quarter national monument of Admiral Chester Nimitz, to be installed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii late in the summer of 2013.
<br>
<br>
              Chad now sculpts on his own, and continues to create, looking for opportunities to create fun, unique, dynamic sculpture designs to sell in galleries, and commemorate our nation's heroes, such as Leonard DeWitt, in the McMinnville monument.

              Chad Caswell Sculptures is located in Troutdale, Oregon in the Caswell Gallery.
